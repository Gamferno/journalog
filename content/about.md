Hey ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a 3rd-year student at **SRM IST NCR**, currently figuring out my way through code, tech, and everything in between.  

I started out with **C++**, and right now Iâ€™m diving deep into **full-stack development** with the **PERN stack**. Lately, Iâ€™ve also been exploring the world of **blockchain** â€” learning **Rust** and trying to build skills that align with where I see myself heading in the future.  

This space is my **journal + blog** (or *journalog* ðŸ˜…). Itâ€™s where I jot down what Iâ€™m learning, experimenting with, or just random tech thoughts that I think are worth sharing.  

If youâ€™re into coding journeys, projects in progress, or the occasional brain dump, youâ€™ll probably find something here.

ðŸ“Œ **Currently into:**  
- Full-stack dev (PostgreSQL + Express + React.js + Node)  
- Rust + Blockchain fundamentals (Solana)  
- Problem solving on LeetCode
